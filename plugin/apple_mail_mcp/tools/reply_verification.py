"""Verify a saved reply's new body landed outside Mail's quoted original.

`reply_to_email` (see `compose.py`) inserts the new reply body via a blind
clipboard paste into Mail's native reply composer, which already contains
the quoted original thread. That paste is not verified by reading back
`content of replyMessage` -- Mail's GUI editor buffer is decoupled from that
scriptable property, so a read-back there always reports the pre-paste
value even after a successful paste (see the comment above the keystroke
step in `compose.py`).

This module verifies the *saved* draft instead, by reading its raw RFC 822
source (via the existing `get_email_source` tool) after the paste has
already landed on disk. If the new body ends up inside Mail's quoted-original
container -- HTML `<blockquote type="cite">` or a plain-text `>`-quoted
block -- instead of above it, this catches that rather than the tool
reporting success on text presence alone (#71).

Heuristic, not exact: substring matching after whitespace/tag normalization
can produce a false negative if Mail's own text engine reformats the pasted
text (autocorrect, smart-quote substitution) before saving. That is a
narrower failure mode than the one this module closes -- a wrong verdict
that still gets caught by *no* match at all is safer than the previous
behaviour, which never checked in the first place.
